                <p class="text-small">One hot summer day, an ant was working diligently on gathering food for the winter. A grasshopper lazily hopped around, playing and enjoying the sun. When the grasshopper asked the ant for some food, the ant refused, saying that he needed to store up food for the winter. The grasshopper didn’t listen and continued to beg for food.

The ant warned the grasshopper that he would regret not gathering food, but the grasshopper didn’t listen. When winter came, the grasshopper had no food and starved to death. The moral of the story is that it’s important to work hard and plan ahead, or else you’ll suffer the consequences later.</p>

                    Story 2 :-The Miller, His Son and Their Donkey 
                </h1>
                <p class="text-small">In this story, a man and his son are taking their donkey to market. The father rides on the donkey and the son walks. Some people passing by say that the father is being unfair to the son, so the father has the son ride on the donkey while he walks. But then people passing by say that the son is being unfair to the donkey, so they switch again. This goes on until they reach the market and they both end up walking because they can’t please everyone. The moral of the story is that you can’t please everyone, so you shouldn’t try.

These are just a few of the many moral stories that have been passed down through the ages. What’s important is that we take the time to learn the lessons they teach. Only then can we hope to make the world a better place.</p>
